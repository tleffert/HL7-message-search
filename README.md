Though this project is seeded from Angular-seed, it is only a skeleton for an app.
Below I provided the two most important steps to getting the app started.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Be sure to run this in the project dir.


Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
